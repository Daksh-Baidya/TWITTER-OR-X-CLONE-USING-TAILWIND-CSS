# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# TWITTER (OR X) CLONE USING TAILWIND CSS

This is a basic UI clone of a popular social media platform known as X (formerly known as TWITTER) using the technology called TailWind CSS. It's made in react js and not in basic HTML file because there was some problems going on with my device while importing the TailWind normally, that's why it's made in react js. This project mainly focuses of the UI clone of X using TailWind CSS.
